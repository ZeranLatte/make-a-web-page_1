  <div class="Concept"><b>1.HTML CSS Javascript</b></div>
  <div class="Text"><p>They are all programming languages for making webpage. HTML is for the structure;CSS is for the style;Javascript is for the interactive elements.</P>
    <p>The structure used to write HTML and organize elements in a webpage is like a tree. 
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="images/div_tree.png" alt="screen of the app"></div>
    <p>Note: DOM(Document Object Model) refers to the tree structure.
    </p>
    <p>Tips: Use Chrome to open any webpage and open tools-Developer tool to see the source code of this webpage.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="Concept"><b>2.HTML structure and BOX model</b></div>
  <div class="Text"><p>All elements in the webpage are rectangular enen though they are displayed as other shapes. These elements can also be viewed as box in HTML environment. "div" is the tag name to include a box, followed by some attributes named "class" in HTML. By making structures like this in HTML, sorts of content can be classified hierarchically. Also, the structure enables the browser to recogize to correct pattern and part to be correctly displayed. What's more, it brings easy readability for other people who need to review the HTML code. See a example HTML code here:</p></div>
  <div class="image"><img src="images/div.jpg" alt="screen of the app"></div>

  <div class="Concept"><b>3.Use CSS</b></div>
  <div class="Text"><p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It used to add styles to our webpage. CSS has a important propery: inheritance. In the tree, the children can inherit the properties of their parents. Note that descendant only inherits text-related property not box-related property. Befefit of inheritance:</p>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Avoid repetitation, make the code more organized and simple to make changes. For example, if we want to change font of name for each pair of shoes in a shopping webpage, we just need to change one line of code in the "shoe name" class in CSS file.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Enable fast-loading webpage<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Clients save money on bandwidth<br>

    <p>An example of CSS code<br>
    h1 { <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:&nbsp;red;<br>
    } </p>
    A full structure of box contains margin, border, padding and content.
